## ⏳ WAITING ON BRYCEN

### 1. Domain Purchase
**Need:** reviewpilot.com or reviewpilot.ai

**Once purchased:**
- Point DNS to Netlify (I'll give you exact settings)
- Update SITE_URL env var in Netlify
- SSL will auto-provision

---

### 2. Google Cloud Console Setup
**What this enables:** Auto-monitor Google Business Profile reviews

**Steps** (I'll walk you through when ready):
1. Create Google Cloud project
2. Enable Google Business Profile API
3. Create OAuth credentials
4. Add credentials to Netlify env vars

**Without this:** Site still works, but users manually paste reviews (current state)

**With this:** Reviews auto-fetch from Google Business Profile → Full automation
